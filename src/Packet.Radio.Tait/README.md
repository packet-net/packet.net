# Packet.Radio.Tait

> Tait TM8100/TM8200 mobile-radio control over CCDI — the driver that gives the Packet.NET stack RSSI, hardware carrier-sense, PTT, and a radio-native side channel.

A [`Packet.Radio`](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Packet.Radio) `IRadioControl` implementation for Tait TM8100/TM8200 radios over CCDI (the Computer-Controlled Data Interface — the radio's serial command protocol). Wire it to `RssiTaggingTransport` / `CarrierSenseTxGate` and a bare KISS packet link gains per-frame signal metadata and hardware CSMA. Part of [Packet.NET](https://github.com/packet-net/packet.net), a .NET amateur-radio / AX.25 packet stack.

## Install
```sh
dotnet add package Packet.Radio.Tait
```

## What it surfaces that a bare KISS modem cannot

- **RSSI in dBm** (CCTM queries 063/064, 0.1 dB resolution) — feed `RssiTaggingTransport` to stamp per-frame RSSI/SNR onto received AX.25 frames.
- **Hardware carrier-sense** — unsolicited PROGRESS "receiver busy / not busy" messages become `CarrierSenseChanged` events + a `ChannelBusy` property (a true RF-level DCD).
- **Transmitter keying** (`SetTransmitterAsync`) — CCDI-forced TX ignores the radio's TX timer, so the driver unkeys on dispose if you left it keyed through it.
- **Telemetry + health** — PA temperature (CCTM 047), forward/reverse power detector readings (CCTM 318/319, an antenna-health proxy while transmitting), and a periodic **`TaitRadioHealthMonitor`** that trends them: idle-offset-corrected fwd/rev + ratio (a TREND, never VSWR — the detectors are raw √P-scaled millivolts per Tait's service docs), typed sample events + rolling min/median/max summaries.
- **Identity** — model/tier, CCDI version, serial number, firmware/hardware version inventory.
- **An escape hatch** (`TransactRawAsync`) for CCDI commands the driver doesn't model yet — framing and checksumming handled, responses returned decoded.

## Usage
```csharp
await using var radio = TaitCcdiRadio.Open("/dev/ttyUSB0"); // 28800 8N1 default
await radio.SetProgressMessagesAsync(true);                 // per-session: enables DCD events

var id = await radio.QueryIdentityAsync();                  // e.g. "Tait TM8110", serial, versions
float rssi = await radio.ReadRssiDbmAsync();                // e.g. -90.3
radio.CarrierSenseChanged += (_, e) => Console.WriteLine($"DCD {(e.Busy ? "up" : "down")} at {e.At:O}");
```

The radio must be programmed with its data port in **Command mode** (the power-up state) at the matching baud rate; this driver does not attempt the Transparent-mode escape sequence.

## Beyond telemetry

The driver models the rest of the documented surface: channel report/change (`QueryCurrentChannelAsync` / `GoToChannelAsync`), CANCEL / DIAL, and **SDM short-data messages** — radio-to-radio, no TNC: plain 32-character (`SendSdmAsync`) and extended 128-character (`SendExtendedSdmAsync`), requiring SDMs enabled in the radio's programming. `TaitSdmSideChannel` exposes SDMs as a `Packet.Radio.IRadioSideChannel`, the mode-agnostic coordination plane the tuning / mode-negotiation stack rides. Also: display query, Transparent mode (the radio's own FFSK/THSD modem as a byte pipe), a keep-alive **watchdog** (`ConnectionState` + events; probes on link silence, self-heals on recovery), **port auto-detection** (`TaitRadioPortDiscovery` — probes candidate ports with a MODEL query and identifies radios by CCDI serial number), and the whole **CCR mode** (`TaitCcrSession`, TM8100 only): run-time RX/TX frequency in Hz, TX power, bandwidth, CTCSS/DCS, Selcall encode/decode events, volume, and the pulse ping.

## CCR-over-SDM ⚠ experimental / unsafe

`UnsafeSendCcrOverSdmAsync` transmits a CCR command *into another radio* over the air — remote control that can retune, re-power, or key the target, with **no consent handshake in the protocol**. It is `[Experimental]` (`PKTTAIT001`) and carries the `Unsafe` prefix deliberately: a radio not already in CCR mode simply ignores it (immune), but any real deployment needs an application-layer consent/auth gate first — keep it to bench tooling and radios you own. See the [CCDI spike doc](https://github.com/packet-net/packet.net/blob/main/docs/research/tait-ccdi-spike.md).

Verified on hardware: 2× TM8110 (`TMAB12-B100`, CCDI 03.02, firmware 02.18.00.00). On that firmware the CCDI-side TX-power set (FUNCTION 0/7) answers "unsupported command" — but the CCR-mode power command works, so power control lives on `TaitCcrSession`.

Status: **experimental**, spike-born (plan §5.10 Phase 10). Protocol reference: Tait MMA-00038-06 "TM8100/TM8200 CCDI Protocol Manual".

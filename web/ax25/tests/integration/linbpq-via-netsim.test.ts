/**
 * End-to-end interop against the live LinBPQ docker container via net-sim.
 * Modelled on the C# `LinbpqViaNetsimConnectedMode` test
 * (`tests/Packet.Interop.Tests/Linbpq/LinbpqViaNetsimConnectedMode.cs`):
 *
 *   - We attach our `TcpKissTransport` to net-sim's KISS-TCP listener on
 *     127.0.0.1:8100 (node `a`).
 *   - LinBPQ — running inside docker as `pn-linbpq`, NODECALL=PN0TST —
 *     dials net-sim from the docker network on 8102 (node `c`).
 *   - net-sim's afsk1200 sim bridges frames between the two nodes, so to
 *     `Ax25Stack` it looks like a normal AX.25 peer.
 *
 * This is the first proof that ax25.ts can interoperate with a real
 * third-party AX.25 stack (BPQ, mature C implementation, ~30 years of
 * provenance). The unit-test suite drives ax25.ts against itself via
 * paired MockTransports — that proves the SDL tables are internally
 * consistent but doesn't prove they wire-match a peer that wasn't built
 * from the same tables.
 *
 * Bring the stack up first:
 *
 *   docker compose -f docker/compose.interop.yml up -d --wait
 *
 * Then run:
 *
 *   npm run test:integration
 *
 * The describe block is gated on `127.0.0.1:8100` being reachable —
 * if you don't have docker up, the whole file is `describe.skipIf`-skipped
 * with a one-line "stack not up" reason, so this is safe to leave wired
 * into CI / local dev.
 *
 * The C# `PNTEST` (no SSID) is used by `LinbpqViaNetsimConnectedMode`;
 * we use `PNTEST-1` to dodge any chance of address collision when the two
 * test suites run concurrently against the same docker stack.
